    <section><title>Knowledge Editor Overview</title>   
        <para>The Editor allows the user to view, modify, and add new terminologies and value sets
            to their medical dictionary. By default, the Editor is divided into 2 sections: the
                <emphasis role="bold">task</emphasis> pane and the <emphasis role="bold">concept
                viewer</emphasis> pane. When a concept is selected on the left task pane, its
            details can be viewed in the right details pane. </para>

            <para>Once a concept is selected, its details is displayed on one of the Concept Viewer
                panes. The pane lists the general concept information such as STAMP (define STAMP), its
                descriptions which include additional names it may be known by in other languages and
                dialects, and the axiom history which illustrates its taxonomy relationship. Details
                such as the inferred information or inactive items can be toggled on by selecting
                "Display options" in the upper right corner, and its refset relationships and history
                can be found in tabs within the same panel.</para>

        <para>Imported dictionaries are displayed in a hierachical view under the "Taxonomy" tab
            (the left panel). To expand each node, select the caret icon next to each concept. If
            you open a concept using the search method, the term's hierarchical location will be

                <para>Knowledge has implemented Lucene as one of it's search engines. Lucene is an 
                    open-source full-text search library. Both Simple Search and Advanced Search described 
                    in the subsequent sections use Lucene. With the Lucene syntax you can easily perform
                    searchs for more details on the Lucene search syntax refer to the Lucene tutorial

                        Search" and "SNOMED Filters" sections of the Search tab. Select the button
                        "Search" to retrieve results after any search criteria changes. Selecting
                        the "Reset" button will clear all fields in the Search tab. A figure of the

                    <para>In the Knowledge Authoring application you can connect th concept selected in the
                        search results and in the taxonomy to the Concept Viewer Panel. By default in connection
                        or linkage is set. This means when you select a concept in the taxonomy the Concept
                        Viewer will display the details of that concept. The same is true if select a result
                        from a search. You can modify the linkage by toggling the linkage icon in the upper
                        lefthand corner of the concept details panel.

                <para>A briefcase is where you can temporarily hold concepts so that you can review them
                    later. For example, if you run the classifier and it identifies multiple duplicates, you
                    may want to add them to your briefcase so that you can access the list of concepts
                    quickly to compare. Or if you're reviewing the concept's associated members, the table
                    may have an option to add them to your briefcase.</para>

                <para>Release statistics are a set of descriptive measures and statistics obtained
                    through automated queries with the objective of providing information on content
                    changes and temporal trends as a measurement of progress. You can download this

        <para>The Knowledge Editor integrates a high performance Classifier--SnoRocket <link
            xlink:href="https://aehrc.com/snorocket/">https://aehrc.com/snorocket/</link>--which
            supports OWL EL++ and Concrete Domains. The classifier evaluates the stated relationships
            based on <emphasis role="italic">Description Logics </emphasis>upon which the terminology is
            defined and generates the inferred relationships for each concept. The Knowledge Editor
            displays <emphasis role="italic">stated and inferred </emphasis>views of the concept in the
            <emphasis role="italic">concept viewer pane </emphasis>and the Taxonomy displays
            <emphasis role="italic">stated and inferred </emphasis>is-a relationships based on the
            Taxonomy display options.</para>

            <title>How Do I Run the Classifier?</title>
            <para>There are 2 places in the Knowledge Editor interface to run the classifier: at the
                main navigation menu under "Authoring" and in the "Classifier" tab on the left pane. </para>
            <para>The initial run of the classifier after the start of the system will result in all
                concepts being evaluated. Subsequent classifications will only evaluate modified
                concepts, also known as incremental classification. Incremental classification will
                continue so long as the classifier status cache is maintained. This number is only a
                measure of how much work the classifier did. </para>

            <title>How Do I View Previous Classifier Results?</title>
            <para>When you open the Classifier tab under the Authoring interface, there is a table of
                previously run classifications. You may view classifications  results selecting a
                different classification run from the dropdown "Classifier runs".</para>
            <para>To view any of these runs, select one and it will display in a concept viewer on the
                right.</para>
            <para>Here, a summary of attributes and types are displayed including:

                have the option of adding concepts to your briefcase.</para>
            <para>If you discover any inaccuracies or equivalencies after a classification, edits must
                be made directly at the concept level. Refer to "How to Edit a Concept" for information
