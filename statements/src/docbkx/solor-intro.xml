            <para>Symbolic information uses symbols to represent perception, interpretation,
                communication, knowledge, facts, data, and planning. Symbolic information is
                specifically concerned with symbolic representation and interpretational infrastructure.<citation>Information</citation></para>
            <para>An interpretational infrastructure establishes meaning, value, and usefulness for the
                symbols, and can generate and decode the symbols. Without consistent meaning of the
                symbols, there can be no stable knowledge, facts, or data. After the initial assignment
                or development of meaning, the interpretation of symbols must remain consistent if the
                symbols are to be used for perception, memory, communication, or planning.</para>
            <para>Symbols have no meaning or usefulness without an interpretational infrastructure.
                Because the symbols and the interpretational infrastructure are both essential, they
                must develop or evolve together.</para>

        <para>The essential challenge of informatics practice within the healthcare

            is to quickly deliver a high fidelity reasoned interpretation of principles and facts to
            the point of care—and then to quickly aggregate these point of care experiences for
            analytic analysis so that new principles and facts can be formulated and validated as
            part of a continuous optimization of healthcare knowledge and delivery. To effectively
            answer this challenge, we must focus on simplification and integration of knowledge
            assets, and on build, test, deploy, and release processes for delivering these assets to
            the points of care and analysis. This focus on perhaps mundane topics is not because we
            think that novelty has no place in our work; rather, that without a focus on aspects of
            our delivery challenge that are often treated as peripheral to the overall problem, we
            cannot achieve reliable, rapid, low-risk knowledge-asset development and delivery in an
            efficient manner.</para>

            seeks a holistic approach to architecture that supports novelty within a rigorous—and

            testers, build managers, and operations personnel to work together effectively to
            deliver assets to the points of care and analysis. This pipeline must support integrated
            delivery of iterative revisions of specifications, services, and content which are today
            delivered by isolated silo organizations that place the implementation burden upon their
            consumers. This pipeline will be built from existing software-based best practices, and
            will embrace DevOps culture and practice by emphasizing collaboration and communication
            while automating the process of product delivery. ISAAC’s KOMET (KnOwledge Management

            cited that great strides have been made in healthcare data interoperability in the past
            decade…the vast majority of clinicians and patients have access to some portion of their
            health data in electronic format, thanks to the proliferation of electronic health
            record (EHR) systems installed in clinical care environments. The data in these EHRs
            usually follow HL7’s Consolidated Clinical Document Architecture (C-CDA) as it has
            become the generally accepted primary data standard for structured clinical data
            exchange.</para>
        <para>However, the whitepaper also found that significant gaps exist in the accurate
            encoding of the data contained in those C-CDA documents – in an analysis conducted of
            C-CDA documents produced by various EHR vendors and clinical organizations, the four
            most frequent problems identified as part of this analysis were that medications should
            be encoded in RxNorm
            (<?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190305T083855-0700" comment="Is this saying that while these standards should be used, the cited percentages are showing that in fact, in the majority of cases they are not being used?

            sampled

            In short - even though standards and value sets exist for the encoding of data in EHRs,
            in the vast majority of instances this is simply not being done.</para>
        <para>These issues can have a direct impact on patient safety and point to the need to be
            able to consistently represent and encode clinical data and observations. This is the
            next great challenge to conquer for health data interoperability to positively influence
            patient outcomes nationwide through clinical decision support. </para>
        <para>When considering these challenges, it can be daunting to consider from where to start.
            There are hundreds of thousands of clinicians around the world, and up to the current
            century each was documenting their observations from seeing patients in their own way.
            Granted there have been efforts over the years to standardize medical terminology in
            order to encode it properly into systems, but even then there are instances where
            nuances of medical observations cannot be captured consistently, from something as basic
            as nuances of language (e.g.. English versus Chinese) to the specifics of how a
            measurement was actually taken procedurally - for example, in arriving at a quantitative
            measurement such as 90 beats per minute for a patient's pulse, one clinician may have
            used a pulseometer, while another may have arrived at that measurement using fingers to
            the patient's left wrist and a stopwatch. While the quantitative measurement is the
            same, the procedural information should also be documented and the differences
            noted.</para>

    <section><title>Separation of Concerns</title><para>A systematic way to think about this
            (borrowed from the software development industry) is something called Separation of
            Concerns. Separation of Concerns is an architectural design principle that allows a
            complete system to be subdivided into several distinct sections. If concerns are well
            separated from each other, individual sections may be able to be reused, as well as
            worked on and updated independently to address new requirements and use cases. This is
            especially useful and important in a medical context given how many different health
            information and clinical terminology projects are ongoing at any given time, efforts
            that are often uncoordinated and led by disparate and unrelated standards development
            organizations.</para><para>The following diagram shows how the concept of Separation of
            Concerns can be applied to the problem of systematically and consistently representing
            data from clinical observations: <inlinemediaobject>
