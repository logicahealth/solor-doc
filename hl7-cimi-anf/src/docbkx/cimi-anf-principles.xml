                    </footnote>:  Separation of Concerns (SoC) is a design principle for separating a computer program into distinct sections, such that each section addresses a separate concern.  A concern is a set of information that affects the code of a computer program.  A concern can be as general as the details of the hardware the code is being optimized for, or as specific as the name of a class to instantiate.  A program that embodies SoC well is called a modular program.  Modularity, and hence separation of concerns, is achieved by encapsulating information inside a section of code that has a well-defined interface.  Encapsulation is a means of information hiding.  Layered designs in information systems are another embodiment of separation of concerns (e.g., presentation layer, business logic layer, data access layer, persistence layer).  The value of separation of concerns is simplifying development and maintenance of computer programs.  When concerns are well-separated, individual sections can be reused, as well as developed and updated independently.  Of special value is the ability to later improve or modify one section of code without having to know the details of the other sections, and without having to make corresponding changes to those sections.</para>
                <para>The use of immutable objects (see principle B Immutability below) is a technique that fulfills the Separation of Concerns principle.</para>
                <para>Attributes that describe specific semantic concepts should be grouped together into a single class and not be spread across a number of classes.  Doing the latter leads to tight coupling between classes.  Doing the former leads to better decomposition of a potentially complex domain.</para>

                    <xref linkend="cimi_anf_separation_layers_0139"/> shows the Statement layer is separate from Terminology layers, yet most CIF statement models mix terminolgy concerns into the structural attributes of the statement model.  ANF attempts to maintain a clean separation between these layers.  The Language and Definitional layers are used to define what is being measured, such as Dot-blot hemorrhage of the retina or Type 1 diabetes.

                    </footnote>:  Used in object-oriented and functional programming, an immutable object is something that cannot be changed after it is created, in contrast to mutable objects that can be changed after they are created.  There are multiple reasons for using immutable objects, including improved readability and runtime efficiency and higher security.</para>
                <para>Although building immutable objects requires a bit more up-front complexity, the downstream simplification forced by this abstraction easily offsets the effort.  One of the benefits of switching to a functional mindset is the realization that tests exist to check that changes occur successfully in code.  In other words, testing’s real purpose is to validate mutation – and the more mutation you have, the more testing is required to make sure you get it right.  If you isolate the places where changes occur by severely restricting mutation, you create a much smaller space for errors to occur and have few plates to test.</para>
                <para>Finally, one of the best features of immutable classes is how well they fit into the composition abstraction.</para>

                    <emphasis role="bold">Composition Over Inheritance:  </emphasis>Composition over inheritance (or composite reuse principle) in object-oriented programming is the principle that classes should achieve polymorphic behavior and code reuse by their composition (by containing those instances of other classes that implement the desired functionality) rather than inheritance from a base or parent class.</para>
                <para>To favor composition over inheritance is a design principle that gives the design higher flexibility.  It is more natural to build business-domain classes out of various components than trying to find commonality between them and creating a family tree.</para>
                <para>Initial design is simplified by identifying system object behaviors in separate interfaces instead of creating a hierarchical relationship to distribute behaviors among business-domain classes via inheritance.  This approach more easily accommodates future requirements changes that would otherwise require a complete restructuring of business-domain classes in the inheritance model.</para>

                    <emphasis role="bold">Clinical Statement Model Stability:</emphasis>Stability is different from immutability.  Stable means that the model can still meet unanticipated requirements without having to change.  It is not acceptable to change the model every time a new way to administer a drug or to treat a condition is identified.  By representing these types of potentially dynamic concerns in the terminology expressions, as opposed to static fields in a class structure, we do not have to change the model every time something new is discovered.  As Terry Winograd said, anticipating breakdowns, and providing a space for action when they occur, is a design imperative.</para>
                <para>In some regards, in this context “stable” means “not brittle.”  A model easily broken by changes that someone could anticipate is one possible definition of brittle.  A stable model is critical in the phase of a known changing landscape.  We do that by isolating areas of anticipated change into a dynamic data structure.  That dynamic data structure may also be immutable in an object that represents a clinical statement.</para>

The modeling approach should avoid the use of design by constraint (except for terminology binding and attribute type constraints) as it violates proper decoupling and encapsulation.  An example of design by constraint is to create a single procedure class containing all attributes for all known procedures and constraining out irrelevant attributes in a more specialized model.  This approach is very difficult to implement and violates numerous object-oriented best practices.</para>

While the refinement of the semantics of an attribute in a subclass is acceptable, a change of meaning is problematic.  For instance, in FHIR, the Composition class defines an attribute called Subject.  In some subclasses, the attribute may be the entity that this composition refers to (e.g., the patient in a medical record).  In other cases, it is the topic being discussed by the composition (e.g., a medication orderable catalog).</para>
