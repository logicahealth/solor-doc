    <section><title>Knowledge Editor Overview</title>   
        <para>The Editor allows the user to view, modify, add new concepts and create new value
            sets. This section provides an overview of Knowledge areas and a description. 
            The Editor provides an environment for all users to create, modify and export terminology. 
            Users are able to see changes made by all users in real-time.By
            default, the Editor is divided into 3 sections: the <emphasis role="italic"
                >task</emphasis> pane, the <emphasis role="italic">concept viewer</emphasis>, and the
            navigation bar see figure X below. </para>

        <section><title>Task Pane</title>
            <para>The Task Pane has several tabs that perform different functions, such as the
            Taxonomy, Sets, Search, Classifier, and Briefcase. Each of these functions are described
            in preceding sections: taxonomy view, sets, search, classifier, and the brief
            base.</para>
            <section><title>Taxonomy View</title>
                  <para>Through the Taxonomy view, users can navigate through the concept hiearchy is to traverse the
                    taxonomy tree located in the left pane. You can traverse the tree by selecting
                    the caret symbol on the left of the tree to display the selected concept's
                    children.<mediaobject>

                 <simplesect><title>Tree View</title>
                 <para>The tree-like structure of the Taxonomy View allows you to navigate content
                        from a "top-down" view – user can navigate up or down in the lineage of the
                        content. The user can also select to display the <emphasis role="italic">inferred</emphasis> 
                        or <emphasis role="italic">stated</emphasis> view ofmthe content. The default is to display 
                        the <emphasis role="italic">inferred</emphasis> view. The inferred view shows the parent-child 
                        lineage that has been inferred after classification and the <emphasis role="italic">stated</emphasis> 
                        view shows the parent-child lineage that has been stated by the author. </para></simplesect>
                 <simplesect><title>Status</title>
                  <para>In addition, the user can select to display  <emphasis role="italic">active</emphasis> only 
                        concepts or both <emphasis role="italic">active </emphasis> and 
                        <emphasis role="italic">inactive</emphasis> concepts. The default is set to display
                        both <emphasis role="italic">active</emphasis>concepts and

            <section><title>Sets</title>
                <para>You can create, and modify Value Sets, and Map Sets in Knowledge in the Sets tab. Value Sets are a collection
                      of concepts that is used for a specific purpose. e.g. Wound Color Value Set would contain the concepts needed 
                      to describe the color of a wound by a clinician.</para> </section>
            <section><title>Search</title>
                <para>You can perform a search in the Authoring interface. On the left pane,here are two
                    options to find the concepts: under the taxonomy tab or by the search tab.
                    Knowledge has implemented Lucene as one of it's search engines. Lucene is an 
                    open-source full-text search library. Both Simple Search and Advanced Search described 
                    in the subsequent sections use Lucene. With the Lucene syntax you can easily perform
                    searchs for more details on the Lucene search syntax refer to the Lucene tutorial
                    <link xlink:href="http://www.lucenetutorial.com"> Lucene tutorial</link></para>
            <simplesect><title>Simple Search</title>
                <para>Terminologies can be searched by keywords under the Search tab in the left
                    pane. Begin After the keywords are entered, select the button "Search" to
                    retrieve results.</para>
                <para>Simple search allows you to search for the keyword that you typed in the
                    search box without selecting and advanced search or SNOMED CT options.
                    Selecting the search button will return all descriptions that matches. 
                </para></simplesect>
            <simplesect><title>Advanced Search</title>
                <para>There are several ways to refine the search criteria under  "Advanced
                    Search" and "SNOMED Filters" sections of the Search tab. Select the button
                    "Search" to retrieve results after any search criteria changes. Selecting
                    the "Reset" button will clear all fields in the Search tab. A figure of the
                    available filter criteria is shown below.</para>

              <simplesect><title>Saved Searches</title>
                  <para>Search criteria can be saved for later user under the Search tab. To do so,
                      enter the search criteria and select the "Search" button. A results section
                      should appear below the search fields along with options to save the search and
                      to export the results to a CSV file. Select the "Save Search" link in order to
                      name and save the search.</para>
                  <para>Saved searches are retrieved under the "saved searches" section of the search
                      tab. This section is only visible if there are previously saved searches. Select
                      the desired search from a dropdown list and press the "Search" button to pull
                      results.</para></simplesect>

        <section><title>Classifier</title>
            <para>The Knowledge Editor integrates a high performance Classifier--SnoRocket <link
                xlink:href="https://aehrc.com/snorocket/">https://aehrc.com/snorocket/</link>--which
                supports OWL EL++ and Concrete Domains. The classifier evaluates the stated relationships
                based on <emphasis role="italic">Description Logics </emphasis>upon which the terminology is
                defined and generates the inferred relationships for each concept. The Knowledge Editor
                displays <emphasis role="italic">stated and inferred </emphasis>views of the concept in the
                <emphasis role="italic">concept viewer pane </emphasis>and the Taxonomy displays
                <emphasis role="italic">stated and inferred </emphasis>is-a relationships based on the
                Taxonomy display options.</para>

                    <title>Initiate Classification</title>
                    <para>There are 2 places in the Knowledge Editor interface to run the classifier: at the
                        main navigation menu under "Authoring" and in the "Classifier" tab on the left pane. </para>
                    <para>The initial run of the classifier after the start of the system will result in all
                        concepts being evaluated. Subsequent classifications will only evaluate modified
                        concepts, also known as incremental classification. Incremental classification will
                        continue so long as the classifier status cache is maintained. This number is only a
                        measure of how much work the classifier did. </para>

                    <para>When you open the Classifier tab under the Authoring interface, there is a table of
                        previously run classifications. You may view classifications  results selecting a
                        different classification run from the dropdown "Classifier runs".</para>

                    <title>How do I link Taxonomy and Search to Concept Viewer?</title>
                    <para>In the Knowledge Authoring application you can connect th concept selected in the
                        search results and in the taxonomy to the Concept Viewer Panel. By default in connection
                        or linkage is set. This means when you select a concept in the taxonomy the Concept
                        Viewer will display the details of that concept. The same is true if select a result
                        from a search. You can modify the linkage by toggling the linkage icon in the upper
                        lefthand corner of the concept details panel.

                <para>A briefcase is to temporarily hold concepts so that you can review them later.
                    For example, if you run the classifier and it identifies multiple duplicates,
                    you may want to add them to your briefcase in order to access the list of
                    concepts quickly for comparison. Or if you're reviewing the concept's associated
                    members, the table may have an option to add them to the briefcase.</para>
                <para>To add a terminology to the briefase from some lists such as classifier page,
                    select the briefcase icon (not all tables have this feature). In the example
                    below, there is an "Add to Briefcase" icon on the 5th column of the members
                    table and an option to "Add all to Briefcase" above the table.</para>

            <title>Creating an Export</title>
            <para>There are two types of exports that can be created: a local downloadable file, and a
                release version that is uploaded to the repository. Exports and releases created are
                specific to the module you are working on. Once a release is created, you have the
                option of downloading it onto your system.</para>
            <para>When an export is initiated, several steps happen in the background: the classifier is
                run, a QA check is performed, and then a file is packaged for download.</para>
            <para>To create an export, go to the Export Management interface and on the left pane there
                is a table of Exports and QA, filtered by Path. Select the "Actions…" dropdown and
                "Create an Export".</para>
            <para>A modal appears asking which path the release should be created under, the file type
                for export, and a few additional details. Select "Create" to confirm and execute the
