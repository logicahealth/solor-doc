        <title>Introduction</title>
        <para>Concrete domains are used to model concrete properties such as numbers, time
            intervals, and spatial regions.<citation>reasonConcreteDomain</citation> However, a
            limitation of description logic is the ability to fully represent concrete values. For
            example, "male husband is younger than a female spouce" could only be represented by an
            abstract mean and does not fully capture the semantics.<citation>complexity_DL_concreteDomain</citation> </para>
        <para>In patient records, there is no shortage of a need to represent these values (weight,
            temperature, dosages, etc), and SNOMED CT has already begun work on addressing concrete
            domain. In order to "stand on the
            <?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190313T103040-0600" comment="Should this be &quot;shoulders&quot;?" flag="done"?>shoulder<?oxy_comment_end?>s
            of giants", Solor developers rely heavily on current SNOMED CT work to extend the
            representation of concrete domains. Therefore, the intent of this discussion is to
            propose the use of the SNOMED CT model to represent and reason over values like integers
            in Description Logic.</para>

        <para>This initial work focused on medications and evaluating the use of concrete domains to
            represent not only the product strength, but also the unit of use size. To fully test
            the feasibility of concrete domains, additional attributes were also added, in order to
            fully represent all information regarding medications, which will then allow concepts to
            be fully defined. Thus, this will enable testing the equivalence and subsumption of
            concepts by the Description Logic classifiers within the tooling.</para>
        <para>At the beginning of the project there was no ability to represent numeric attributes
            of concepts in SNOMED CT, which made machine readability of numeric attributes
            difficult, prone to error, and left a large portion of Products as primitive concepts.
            Without the ability to fully represent the numeric properties, equivalence checking and
            subsumption using the Description Logic classifier is not possible. With the
            introduction of the new Drug Concept Model in the
            <?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190313T103809-0600" comment="If this was in fact released at that time, this sentence should be revised accordingly." flag="done"?>July
            2017<?oxy_comment_end?> International Release the representation of product strength and
            units has begun to be modeled. However, this new Drug Concept Model currently does not
            utilize concrete domains but instead creates the strength numbers as concepts themselves
            to be used as values for the product strength attributes. </para>

        <title>Approach</title>
        <para>By using a lexical search for strings containing integers and textual representation
            of integers, 10,114 potential Pharmaceutical / Biologic Product concepts were
            identified, which were modeled with the proposed attributes, including one attribute to
            represent product strength. To properly represent the numeric information contained in
            these products, the Australian Medicines Terminology Approach was applied to the
            International SNOMED CT content.</para>
        <para>To speed up the modeling process, already available data around strength and units
            from NDF-RT through RxNorm RXNSAT relationships that was linked to the SNOMED CT
            concepts through the RXCUI was used. Technical validation was performed on these values
            and any incorrect strength or units identified were corrected before using these
            values to populate the relationships. After loading the new relationships into the
            terminology editor, further manual review was conducted to verify the relationships and
            add any missing information.</para>

        <title>Findings</title>
        <para>Under the new SNOMED CT International Drug Concept Model, existing concepts will be
            updated to meet the new modeling guidelines and terming updated to conform to the
            terming guidelines in the editorial guide. One of the most frequent issues found while
            modeling the medication attributes was that the Fully Specified Names (FSN) were not
            completely fully specified or that the values needed to fully define a concept were not
            available. For example, the common issues seen around FSN’s were due to the
            <?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190313T105058-0600" comment="Is this correcct?  " id="dtd_hvr_hhb" flag="done" mid="8"?><?oxy_comment_start author="timowilliams" timestamp="20190403T132411-0500" comment="yes

            or dose form not present or not fully defined in the FSN, but modeled with the more
            specific value in the current Has active ingredient and Has dose form attributes. With
            the SNOMED CT International review and application of the new modeling guidelines, these
            FSN’s should be corrected and fix the issues found with FSN’s.</para>

        <para>Another common issue with fully defining concepts using this proposed model was
            associated with sugar free, gluten free, preservative free, etc. dose forms. This issue
            is currently out of scope for the new SNOMED CT International Drug Concept Model and
            will prevent the concepts that currently exist in SNOMED CT from being fully defined. A
            potential solution for representing these dose forms and fully defining the drug
            concepts would be to create concepts in the qualifier value hierarchy for sugar free
            dose form, gluten free dose form, etc and use a nested relationship to combine it with
            the other appropriate dose form. This would eliminate the need to create all the
            possible combinations of dose forms required to support the Drug Concept Model.</para>

                    <para>This category of concepts mirrors the requirements of the Drug Concept
                        Model most closely and would be very similar in that it would require both
                        an attribute for recording the numeric value and another attribute to record
                        the unit. This would also require the ability to capture less than, greater
                        than and equal to which is not currently something supported in the SNOMED
                        CT International Drug Concept Model. Therefore using concrete domains would
                        be a much more suitable solution as it allows for that capture of that
                        information but would require a change to the SNOMED CT Release Format to
                        accommodate these relationships.</para>

                    <para>This would be a small subset of concepts that would be affected but would
                        be a good target for a set of relationships to use for post-coordination
                        instead of adding pre-coordinated concepts to the standard. Making these
                        relationships strictly available through post-coordination and using
                        concrete domains would not require a change to the release format. It would
                        however require existing concepts (less than 100) to be retired in order for
                        all concepts to be aggregated appropriately.</para>
