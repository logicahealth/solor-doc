     <para>In order to represent the various domains of healthcare, Solor "stands on the shoulder of
        giants" by building on existing content from SNOMED, LOINC, and RxNorm. The purpose of this
        section is to discuss the categories within Solor where concepts reside, as well as the
        relationships used to define the concepts. Ultimately, the goal of this representation of
        concepts and their relationships would support the description logic component of
        Solor.</para>

        <title>Top level categories</title>
        <para>In SNOMED, various hierarchies (e.g. Procedures, Clinical Findings, etc) are used to
            store and maintain various concepts. These hierarchies are typically modeled such that
            higher level concepts (i.e. Disorder of endocrine system) are more generic than lower
            level concepts, which are more granular (e.g. Type 1 diabetes mellitus). Through a
            series of Is a relationships, which will be explained in the next section, one could
            traverse down the hierarchy from a top level generic concept to a very specific concept.
            In an attempt to gather 'like' concepts, Solor created top level categories of concepts
            to 'house' concepts that belong to those categories. This section will describe the
            intent and purpose of these categories. </para>

        <title>Relationship types</title>
        <para>As alluded in earlier sections, each concept with a name by itself does not provide
            any additional knowledge to reason. If the concept "Disorder of endocrine system" is
            placed into a bucket of like concepts, such as "Type 1 diabetes mellitus", without any
            formal definition, one could not possibly deduce that "Type 1 diabetes mellitus" is a
            type of endocrine system disorder. Therefore, a series of relationships must be used to
            properly define the concept so that the concept could contain additional knowledge for
            reasoning to occur. With the simple example of diabetes, it may seem that one could
            simply create an "Is A" relationship to relate "Disorder of endocrine system" and "Type
            1 diabetes mellitus". Although it may connect these two concepts, there needs to be
            additional relationship types to further define each concept to provide more context and
            knowledge such that a concept is further defined and could provide additional knowledge.
            This section describes the relationship types of Solor and provides example of its
            usage. </para>

                                    is more problematic as specific causative agents have not been
