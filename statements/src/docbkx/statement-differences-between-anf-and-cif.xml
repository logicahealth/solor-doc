        <title>The Representation of Topic</title>
        <para>In the ANF Statement model, the topic is represented by a single field containing a
            terminology expression. This expression is not limited to any particular terminology
            model, but in this document we use SNOMED CT, as Solor would potentially have extensions
            to SNOMED CT. In the CIMI Statement model, all the pieces of information that make up
            the topic can be broken out and structured as needed into a tree of objects with
            multiple properties and appropriate datatypes.</para>

        <para>As we can see in the Pulse Rate examples below, the ANF topic is represented as a
            post-coordinated expression while the CIMI topic is represented with a topic containing
            a single concept along with associated structural properties representing the pulse
            oximeter device. Since the ANF Statement will always be either the request for an action
            or the performance of an action, the post-coordinated expression will always be a
            procedure that is further refined providing a consistent <?oxy_comment_start author="kec" timestamp="20190722T173538-0700" comment="Need a section of some sort discussing the benefits of a classifiable topic on aggregation, retrieval, etc. 

Also, the implications of a more complex seperation of concerns with respect to the CIMI topic, and the multiple places within the topic that use codes, wich have their own semantics (LOINC semantics, UCUM semantics, RxNorm, SNOMED CT, etc... And how to reconcile all that simply is a challenge. Having the two possibly working together (CIMI topic can be transformed (normalized) into ANF topic is a potential win-win).

        <para>One implication of this is that the ANF Statement Model is using two formalisms to
            represent the clinical statement. First it uses the formalism that represents the ANF
            reference model. Second, it uses SNOMED CT's syntax for post-coordinated SNOMED CT
            expressions. Tools for authoring and analysis would be required to parse and process
            both syntaxes. </para>
        <para>The CIMI Statement model in this example, on the other hand, would be fully
            represented using the formalism that represents the CIMI reference model. This model
            however allows for the possibility of multiple modeling style representations of the
            same data that are then not easily queried for equivalence. </para>

    <section>
        <title>The Representation of Results</title>
        <para>In the CIMI model, EvaluationResult and Assertion models are used to represent
            observations. EvaluationResult has a topic representing what is being observed, and a
            result represented by a choice of datatypes. EvaluationResult can be thought of as a
            question and an answer. An Assertion on the other hand, has simply a topic stating what
            is observed, and a coded result stating presence or absence.</para>
        <para>In the ANF model, the topic represents what is being observed and the result may only
            be a range of a quantity. No coded results are allowed. Not allowing coded results
            forces more of the semantics to be represented in the terminology model and limits the
            ability to allow multiple different representations of the same data. In the example
            below we see Dot blot hemorrhage represented in ANF as either present or with the number
            of hemorrhages that exist.</para>

            Blood Pressure' and result with a numeric quantity. In this case, the CIMI and ANF model
            are very aligned, except for the fact that the ANF model will always use a range of that

        <para>In this example, the ANF model doesn't support an EvaluationResult style model as it
            doesn't allow coded results. Thus, ANF is forced to make one and only one choice, which
            is an assertion style where the particular breath sound is the topic, and the result
            will be a countable quantity indicating presence or absence.</para>
        <para>When querying instance data, the Assertion or ANF style can be more difficult to
            represent as it requires concepts to be pre-coordinated in the terminology or having
            sufficient semantics available in the concept model to allow for representation of a
            post-coordinated expression. To successfully query any breath sound instances using the
            Assertion/ANF style, the underlying terminology must be correctly modeled to support. If
            one of the breath sound values is not correctly placed under the higher level concept of
            366135003 |Finding of breath sounds (finding)|, then retrieving all breath sounds will
            require knowledge of all the possible breath sound values. With the EvaluationResult
            style, querying is simpler as you simply query for a topic of 'breath sound', and the
            coded result tells you what type of breath sound it is. Thus, you do not have to know
            all the members of the valueset apriori to form the query.</para>

        <title>ANF vs CIMI Examples</title>
        <para>The following examples seek to highlight the differences between the ANF and CIMI
            models. These representations are at a graphic high level and are not intended to be
            exact representations.</para>

            <title>Simple Systolic Blood Pressure Statement</title>
            <para>In this systolic blood pressure example both the ANF and CIMI models are closely
                aligned. Since the ANF model requires both an upper and lower bound there is extra
                information required.</para>

            <title>Complex Systolic Blood Pressure Statement</title>
            <para>In this systolic blood pressure example the ANF model requires multiple statements
                to accurately capture all parts of the narrative clinical statement. The ANF model
                requires a clinical statement to be separated if the clinical statement could stand
                on its own. For example, in the clinical statement "Systolic Blood Pressure 120
                mmHg, taken on right brachial artery, using BP cuff adult size, patient in sitting
                position for at least 5 minutes, urinated not more than 30 minutes prior to
                measurement", the patient sitting position and urination parts of the statement are
                recorded as separate associated clinical statements since they could both be
                recorded as clinical statements on their own if they were not associated with the
                blood pressure clinical statement.</para>
            <para>The ANF model is much more expressive and is able to capture the timing
                information for the position and urination that requires a separate precondition code to be created in the CIMI model.</para>

            <para>The Diabetes Mellitus example highlights the main difference between ANF and CIMI
                in the case of stating that a condition is present. In the case of ANF, since
                Result is not allowed to use a coded value it represents the presence as a
                lowerBound of 1 and an upperBound of infinite. Representing absence would be done
                with an upper and lower bound of zero.</para>
