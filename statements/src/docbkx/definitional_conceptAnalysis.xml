    <title>Content Requiring Special Handling</title>
    <section>
        <title>Purpose</title>
        <para>The creation of groupings (Assemblage) containing SNOMED CT concepts that require
            special handling supports the maintenance of this content over time without the
            necessity of re-reviewing the entire content. Within Solor, these various Assemblages
            are imported and are properly grouped within the system. Subsequently, a set of rules
            could be developed and applied to handle each of the cases appropriately. </para>
        <para>Concepts may require special handling for a number of reasons:<itemizedlist>

            <title>Absence Representation</title>
            <para>Absence, where in the strictest sense within the description logic realm, is "NOT"
                and it means "everything but". If one were to express "not diabetes", it equates to
                "everything but diabetes".</para>
            <para>This is further complicated within SNOMED by the parent-child relationship "Is A".
                Take the following figure as an example:</para>
            <para>
                <figure>
                    <title>Effect of Is A on absence</title>

                            <imagedata fileref="images/definitional_conceptAnalysis_negation_00.svg"
                                scalefit="1" width="100%" contentdepth="100%"/>
                        </imageobject>
                    </mediaobject>
                </figure>
            </para>
            <para>In a hierarchical structure, Is A is a one-way pointer. If B is a child, and A is
                a parent, that means B "Is A" A. However, one cannot flip that relationship. For
                example, one can express that one is "having an apple", and by the definition of "Is
                A", one can assume that one is "having a fruit" (apple is a fruit). However, this
                directionality cannot be flipped because "having a fruit" does not necessarily mean
                that one is "having an apple".</para>
            <para>In a separate example, what if "No apple" is a child of "No fruit"? If one were
                having "no apple", it doesn't necessarily mean that one is having "no fruit" (one
                could very well have other fruits). However, in this scenario, if one were to
                express having "no fruit", one could deduce that one is also having "no apple". Note
                the directionality of the
                <?oxy_comment_start author="steph" timestamp="20190311T130739-0600" comment="Should this be spelled as &quot;Is A&quot;?" flag="done"?>"Is
                A"<?oxy_comment_end?> in this scenario, which is opposite of the previous
                example.</para>
            <para>Not shown in the figure, but what if "No apple" is a child of "Fruit"?</para>
            <para>Although simplistic, this example shows how an

                concept in a hierarchical structure significantly complicates any calculations.
                Without a way to properly identify if a concept is an 'absence' concept,
                computational methods could not be applied because the directionality as shown with
                the apple/fruit example would complicate any calculations.Therefore, it was deemed
                necessary that such "absent" concepts within SNOMED required identification such
                that they can be segregated for further special handling.</para>
            <para>“Absence” vs. “Affirmation” are two polar opposite paradigms within the SNOMED CT
                Concept Model. Where “Affirmation” represents a statement that e.g. a finding or a
                disorder is present, absent states their absence.</para>
            <para>However, in SNOMED, the expression of "no diabetes" is a positive assertion that
                something is not present. This is different than "everything but diabetes". As a
                result, these two potentially different semantics could lead to confusion and delay
                if one were to apply computational methods - does "No diabetes" mean "everything but
                diabetes" or "diabetes is not present"?</para>

            <para>65124004 |Swelling (finding)| vs. 300890009 |Swelling absent (situation)|</para>
            <para>“Absence” concepts are generally located in the 243796009 |Situation with explicit
                context (situation)| hierarchy, where the Context terminological model is
                consistently applied. Concepts including or implying absence, which are located
                outside this hierarchy pose challenges for the logical semantic hierarchies they
                reside in. This study focused only on identifying concepts that are currently not
                located within the “situation with explicit context” hierarchy. Some of these
                identified concepts may need to be relocated to the situation hierarchy as a result
                of this project.</para>
            <para>Currently the logical hierarchy for absence concepts remains “upside-down”.</para>

            <section>
                <title>Approach</title>
                <para>The initial task was to evaluate 50,000 concepts and determine their potential
                    membership in one or more of the Assemblages.</para>
                <para>For each of the Assemblages for inclusion, word patterns that explicitly or
                    implicitly identify a concept as a member of the Assemblage were developed. As a
                    first automated step, queries using string matching of those patterns or
                    keywords were applied to the following SNOMED CT hierarchies:<orderedlist>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Clinical Findings</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Procedures</para>
                        </listitem>
                        <listitem>
                            <para>Body Structures</para>
                        </listitem>
                    </orderedlist></para>
                <para>Based on the keywords, terminologists developed a set of rules for each
                    inclusion/exclusion to be applied to each Assemblage. </para>
                <para>The sets of concepts that resulted from the initial automated query were then
                    assigned to at least two independent reviewers to confirm or deny Assemblage
                    membership for each concept based on the rule sets. Disagreements between the
                    reviewers were extracted and analyzed to determine if the rules needed to be
                    adjusted in order to achieve maximum reproducibility. Adjustments included
                    clarifying rules, adding rules or in some cases eliminating ambiguous rules. </para>
                <para>Certain concepts such as “Dental referral - child (procedure)” or “Fetal
                    distress affecting management of mother (disorder)”, which were identified as
                    ambiguous to an extent, where inclusion or exclusion from Assemblage membership
                    could not be determined were extracted and added to a separate
                    Assemblage.</para>

            <title>Concepts Where Patient Is Not Subject of Record</title>
            <para>The default context of SNOMED CT concepts as stated in the SNOMED CT Editorial
                Guide means that, unless stated otherwise within the description or the definition
                of the concept, clinical findings are occurring to the subject of record (the
                patient) and procedures are performed on the subject of record (the patient). </para>
            <para>The only exceptions are concepts whose description actually contains a specific
                context (e.g. father smokes), and these are all grouped in the “situation with
                explicit context” hierarchy. Concepts, where the patient is not the subject of
                record outside this hierarchy do not adhere to the guidelines. This study did not
                focus on the concepts within the “situation with explicit context” hierarchy as they
                have their context already identified using the context attributes.</para>
            <section>
                <title>Approach</title>
                <para>The initial task was to evaluate 50,000 concepts and determine their potential
                    membership in one or more of the Assemblages.</para>
                <para>For each of the Assemblages for inclusion, word patterns that explicitly or
                    implicitly identify a concept as a member of the Assemblage were developed. As a
                    first automated step, queries using string matching of those patterns or
                    keywords were applied to the following SNOMED CT hierarchies:<orderedlist>
                        <listitem>

                <para>Based on the keywords, terminologists developed a set of rules for each
                    inclusion/exclusion to be applied to each Assemblage. </para>
                <para>The sets of concepts that resulted from the initial automated query were then
                    assigned to at least two independent reviewers to confirm or deny Assemblage
                    membership for each concept based on the rule sets. Disagreements between the
                    reviewers were extracted and analyzed to determine if the rules needed to be
                    adjusted in order to achieve maximum reproducibility. Adjustments included
                    clarifying rules, adding rules or in some cases eliminating ambiguous rules. </para>
                <para>Certain concepts such as “Dental referral - child (procedure)” or “Fetal
                    distress affecting management of mother (disorder)”, which were identified as
                    ambiguous to an extent, where inclusion or exclusion from Assemblage membership
                    could not be determined were extracted and added to a separate
                    Assemblage.</para>

                    reviewers were extracted and analyzed to determine if the rules needed to be
                    adjusted in order to achieve maximum reproducibility. Adjustments included
                    clarifying rules, adding rules or in some cases eliminating ambiguous rules. </para>

                    distress affecting management of mother (disorder)”, which were identified as
                    ambiguous to an extent, where inclusion or exclusion from Assemblage membership
                    could not be determined were extracted and added to a separate
                    Assemblage.</para>

            <para>The purpose of the Laterality Assemblages is to identify concepts that are not
                currently modelled with the correct body structure that utilizes laterality. This
                only pertains to laterality as currently represented in SNOMED CT, which is used to
                designate one or both of paired bilaterally symmetrical (or near symmetrical) body
                structures. It therefore does not apply to sidedness of specific body structures.
                For example 364006 |Acute left-sided heart failure (disorder)| is not a lateralized
                disorder since the heart is not a bilaterally symmetrical body structure. For more
                information on laterality vs sidedness, please see <link

                                correct laterality, it will be marked as incorrect. For example,

                                CT modelling guidance, which requires the use of two separate role
                                groups with one representing the right body structure and one
                                representing the left body structure. If the concept is modelled
                                using the bilateral body structure (e.g. 40638003 |Structure of both
                                eyes (body structure)|), it was added to the Laterality Incorrectly
                                Modeled Assemblage. For example, 12239101000119100 |Bilateral

                            <para>If the concept being evaluated included a plural form of a
                                potentially lateralizable body structure in the FSN, the concept
                                would be considered to represent bilaterality and evaluated it as
                                such. For example, 248422003 |Warm hands (finding)| does not specify
                                right, left, or bilateral in the FSN but since it uses the term
                                “hands,” it would be considered as bilateral and evaluated against the
                                current SNOMED CT modelling guidance as stated above.</para>

                                Not Include Laterality Assemblage. For example, 111283005 |Chronic
                                left-sided heart failure (disorder)| represents heart failure on the
                                left side of the heart. </para>

                                represented one side vs both sides, it was placed in the Ambiguous
                                Laterality Assemblage. For example, “lacrimal canaliculi” concepts
                                were considered to be ambiguous since their FSNs did not specify if
                                it was the lacrimal canaliculi of both eyes or the right or left
                                eye.</para>

            <title>Inverse Concepts</title>
            <para>The purpose of the Inverse Assemblages is to identify concepts that <emphasis
                    role="underline">should</emphasis> have an opposing concept due to a description
                indicating an opposite or inverse concept, regardless of whether that opposing
                concept currently exists in SNOMED CT. It is <emphasis role="underline"
                    >not</emphasis> the purpose to identify and pair opposing concepts. In many
                cases, the opposing concept does not exist in SNOMED CT and the next iteration of
                this Assemblage should be to link the two inverse concepts together to identify
                missing content.</para>

                            where both are children of “Bone deformity.” “Congenital bone deformity”

                <title>Potential Changes to Grades, Scales, Stages, and Scores Concepts</title>
                <para>A consistent model needs to be developed and implemented to ensure Grades, Scales,
                    Stages, and Scores concepts are symmetrical. There are many possible options
                    available for creating a consistent concept model for Grades, Scales, Stages, and
                    Scores but the options outlined below can be accomplished without the addition of
                    new concept model attributes. It will require the addition of 254291000 |Staging and
                    scales (staging scale)| as an allowable value for Interprets. A large number of
                    Observable Entity concepts would either need to be retired or remodeled as subtypes
                    in the Procedure hierarchy.</para>

                (disorder)| concept is modeled using an Interprets to a new concept |American Heart
                Association (AHA) and American College of Cardiology (ACC) Stages of Heart Failure
                (staging scale)| and a Has interpretation to the existing concept 261626008 |Stage C
                (qualifier value)|. Separately, a new Procedure concept would need to be created,
                |Assessment using American Heart Association (AHA) and American College of
                Cardiology (ACC) Stages of Heart Failure (Procedure)|. Since these stages focus on
                the functioning of the cardiovascular system, the new procedure concepts would have
                a Has focus attribute that would link it to the 301458000 |Functional cardiovascular
                finding (finding)|.</para>
